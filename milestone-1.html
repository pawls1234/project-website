                        <h3>Scope Definition</h3>
                        <p>Each year, approximately 6.5 million companion animals enter shelters in the US. Less than half of these animals, however, are adopted [1, 2]. In order to address the rampant issue of pet homelessness and increase the likelihood that these animals will have a second chance at life, we decided to explore how ubiquitous computing can help ensure newly adopted pets are remaining in their new homes. <br><br>

                            In order to narrow the scope of our project, we elected to focus our efforts on newly adopted dogs and their owners. Specifically, we would like to augment the most frustrating parts of the process of the dog’s transition from the shelter to the home, with a focus on the behavioral issues that often arise and cause owners to return their new companions. In order to narrow our scope further, we’d like to specifically focus on the first month after adoption, as that is the critical time period after which most owners who choose to return their dog to the shelter will do so [needs citation].

                        <h3>Motivation</h3>
                        <p>Originally, our group came together and discussed our personal observations. After we explored these observations, we narrowed our ideas down to one potential observation. Since one observation touched on animal shelters, we decided to explore the issues surrounding pet owners and adopting a new dog. Additionally, individual interviews were conducted to provide further context regarding the problems surrounding adopting a dog and introducing them to a new home. Based on these interviews and observations, three different concepts were sketched that focused on recognizing and reducing any potential stress and anxiety that could be occurring in a dog’s environment while transitioning into a new home. After further reviewing our sketches and themes, we came up with the following three concepts: Halo Collar, Doghouse, and Guardian.
